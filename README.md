# resonate-with-me
Arduino code for my interactive sound installation 'Resonate With Me'

## Official description
'Resonate With Me' is an invitation to play and cooperate with another person, co-navigating a whirlwind of noise, trying to find the right frequency that brings each other's contribution into a harmonious duet.
 
By placing two people in a chaotic whirl of bendable sound, this installation attempts to be both an interactive interpretation of the vibrational dynamics between humans, as well as an experimental tool for cooperative sound exploration.
